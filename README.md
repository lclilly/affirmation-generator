🧘🏽‍♀️ Daily Affirmation Generator
A simple Python script that gives you a daily dose of light, encouragement, and presence. It randomly selects an uplifting affirmation or Bible-inspired truth, displays it beautifully, and optionally logs it to a CSV file so you can track your mindset journey.

🌟 Why I Built This
I wanted to create something simple yet grounding — a way to practice “deep work” by starting the day centered and focused. As I grow in my tech career and my faith walk, I believe it's important to build projects that reflect both logic and heart. This one does just that.
